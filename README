This is a simple browser-based flashcard application for studying
Latin grammar paradigms. It provides a dictionary entry for a word, then
the case that you need to put the word in, then it's up to you to type in
the answer.

I'm developing this as I memorize the paradigms, so right now it just has a
couple of noun cases. More will show up as I learn them and need to practice.

You can download the files and run in a browser off of your hard drive, or
just go to http://mattwilson.org/latin/ to use it.
